# HackerOne Embedded Form Configuration
# By setting the hackerone_embed_form field to your program's ID, you can embed a HackerOne
# submission form in your report page!
#
# You can get your HackerOne program's ID by going to Program Settings -> Program tab -> 
# Select "Integrations" under Automation -> Scroll down and select "Configure" next to "Embedded Submission"
#
# Make sure you have added your site's FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to the Embedded Submission configuration and clicked Save
# before pasting in the ID
#
# You can view the embedded form script under your domains list, you only need the part after the https://hackerone.com/ but before the /embedded_submission
# So for example the script code might be
# <script async src="https://hackerone.com/random-characters-here/embedded_submissions/script"
# data-url="https://hackerone.com/random-characters-here/embedded_submissions/new" data-name="h1-embedded-submission"></script>
#
# You only need to copy the random-characters-here part and paste it below.
