# Project

_SecurityTemplate_ is a static website template for security pages, powered by Jekyll. It's easy to get started. Clone this repo, edit the configuration files and content to your liking, and publish with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or on your own server platform.

You can [set up a local environment](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to test your _SecurityTemplate_ static site, and [push to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) if desired.

## `config.yml`

* `company_name` &mdash; replace this with your organization name
* `email` &mdash; replace this with your security contact address
* `bugcrowd_id` &mdash; replace this with your [Bugcrowd ID](https://docs.bugcrowd.com/v1.0/docs/embedded-submission-form), if applicable
* `hackerone_url` and `bugcrowd_url` &mdash; the <b>/report</b> URL will redirect to one of these, if specified.

## `index.md`

The index file is where your security policy lives. To learn more about writing good security policies, please refer to https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/205624665-How-do-we-write-a-good-policy-.

## `advisories.md`

This is where you can list your security advisories. The list is updated every time you add a security advisory to the `_posts` folder.

## `report.md`

This file should contain contact information for security researchers to use when reporting a security vulnerability. If a HackerOne or Bugcrowd URL is specified in `config.yml`, users will be redirected automatically. You can also use an embedded Bugcrowd submission form. Just uncomment the form, and add your Bugcrowd embed token under `bugcrowd_id` in `_config.yml`.

## `hof.md`

This is your security acknowledgements page. List the details of security researchers that reported valid security issues (and wish to be listed publicly).

## `.well-known/security.txt`

`security-template` contains a security.txt template file. _security.txt_ defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to safely disclose vulnerabilities via a simple text file. For more on this, please refer to https://securitytxt.org/.
